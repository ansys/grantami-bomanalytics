This is the default value for processes whose environmental impact is calculated based on the mass of material that goes through the process.

For more information on mass calculations, see the Granta MI documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, apply secondary processes to materials. These are added sequentially to the list of processes on the material object, in the same order as defined by the step_order field.\n\nMaterialProcessingStep processes from the external data source are mapped to Process with a MassRemoved dimension type.
