The Granta MI Scripting Toolkit for Python can be used to translate record history identities into CAS numbers if required.\nNext, look at the state of the zinc alloy record.\nThe zinc alloy record has the status WatchListAllSubstancesBelowThreshold, which means that there are substances present that are impacted by the legislation but are below the 0.1% threshold.\nYou can print these substances using the WatchListBelowThreshold flag as the threshold.\nFinally, look at the stainless steel record.\nThe stainless steel record has the status WatchListCompliant, which means there are no impacted substances in the material.\nYou can print these substances using the WatchListNotImpacted flag as the threshold.\nGroup results by material\ncompliance_by_material_and_indicator\nMaterialWithComplianceResult\nSubstanceWithComplianceResult\nWatchListHasSubstanceAboveThreshold\nIndicator.available_flags\nWatchListAboveThreshold\nWatchListAllSubstancesBelowThreshold\nWatchListBelowThreshold\nWatchListCompliant\nWatchListNotImpacted"

These queries also consider any additional associated BoM items stored in Granta MI.\nFor example, if the specified part record contains links to other parts and specifications, these\nare included in the analysis.\nThe ref_grantami_bomanalytics_api_compliance_bom query accepts a BoM (bill of materials) in\nXML format and returns the compliance status of the BoM based on the BoM’s contents. As opposed to\nrecord-based queries, the BoM compliance analysis only considers items explicitly defined in the\ninput BoM. It does not follow links to other BoM items as in the record-based queries described\npreviously.\nIn both cases, compliance is determined based on a number of\nref_grantami_bomanalytics_api_compliance_indicators. An indicator is a collection of one or\nmore legislations and a threshold. If a certain record directly or indirectly contains substances\nimpacted by one of the specified legislations in an amount that exceeds the threshold, the record is\nnot compliant with that indicator. For more information about possible results, see the definitions\nof the indicators.\nIn general, the result of each query is a recursive BoM (or multi-level BoM) that shows the\ncompliance status and impacted substances at each level. If you are looking for a simple\ndetermination of the substances indirectly or directly contained within a item represented by a\nGranta MI record, consider using the\nref_grantami_bomanalytics_api_impactedsubstances_index.\nThe API documented in this section is only available if you have the MI Restricted\nSubstances feature included in your license.

Usually, just one of the several\noptional fields should be provided; where more than one is provided, the highest priority one is used, where the\ndescending priority order is: tableIdentity, tableGUID, tableName.\nThe identity of the table, this is the fastest way to reference a table.\nThe GUID of the table, this is likely to be a persistent way to refer to a table.\nThe name of the table. Note that table names can vary between localisations of a database, so this may not be a\nsafe way to refer to a table if the MI Database supports multiple locales.\nA type that allows identification of a particular Attribute in an MI Database. This may be done directly by\nspecifying the Identity of the Attribute, or indirectly by specifying a lookup that will match (only) the\nAttribute.\nNote: in certain cases, an MIAttributeReference may match more than one Attribute in\nthe MI Database; depending on the operation, this may be legal or may result in\na Fault.\nThe key that uniquely identifies a particular Database on the MI Server.\nThe identity of the attribute within the MI Database.\nA reference to the table hosting the attribute.

This may be done directly by specifying the Identity or GUID of the Record, or\nindirectly by specifying a lookup that will match (only) the Record.\nFor input, you should provide exactly one of either identity, recordGUID, recordHistoryGUID\nor lookupValue. If more than one element identifying the record is given, only one is used; the descending\norder of priority is: identity, recordGUID, recordHistoryGUID, lookupValue.

Specifies the value to be used for the lookup operation. If this is not unique an error will be\nreturned.\nThe recordUID may be used to identify a particular XML element representing a record. It does not represent\nany property or attribute of an actual MI Record.\nThe fate of a material at the end-of-life of the product.

You can then use this structure directly or use it to construct a pandas.DataFrame object.\nFirst, define a helper function to transform a ComplianceQueryResult object into a dict object. In addition to storing properties that are intrinsic to the item (such as the ID, type, and SVHC result), you want to store structural information, such as the level of the item and the ID of its parent.\nTo help with the flattening process, you also define a schema, which describes which child item types each item type can contain.\nThe function itself performs the flattening using a stack-based approach, where the children of the item currently being processed are iteratively added to the items_to_process stack. Because this stack is being both modified and iterated over, you must use a while loop and .pop() statement instead of a for loop.\nThe stack uses a special type of collection called a deque, which is similar to a list but is optimized for these sorts of stack-type use cases involving repeated calls to .pop() and .extend() statements.\nFinally, call the preceding function against the results from the compliance query and use the list to create a pandas.DataFrame object.\nFlatten the hierarchical data structure\nlist\ndict\ndict\ndict\npandas.DataFrame\nComplianceQueryResult\ndict\nitems_to_process\nwhile\n.pop()\nfor\ndeque\nlist\n.pop()\n.extend()\npandas.DataFrame"

The convention is that a worse result is greater than a better result.\nNow call this function for each component in a dict comprehension to obtain a mapping between part number and compliance status.\nThese results include text defined by the API for compliance status.

        "text": "The PyGranta BoM Analytics API can be used to determine compliance against one or more indicators. An indicator\nessentially represents a legislation with a threshold. If a substance appears in a certain item, either directly or\nindirectly, in a quantity that exceeds that threshold, the item is non-compliant with that indicator. In cases where\nthe legislation defines a per-substance threshold (for example, RoHS), then this per-substance threshold is used\ninstead.\nIndicators can include a list of legislations, in which case a substance is impacted by the indicator if it is\nimpacted by one or more legislations included in that indicator.\nThere are two different types of indicator, and they compute compliance in slightly different ways. It is therefore\nimportant to understand the differences between them. For more information, see the\nRestricted Substances Reports User Guide supplied with\nGranta MI Restricted Substances Reports.\nIndicators"
