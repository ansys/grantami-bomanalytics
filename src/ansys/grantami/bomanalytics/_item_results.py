    ``[ItemType]WithComplianceResult`` class.

    A compliance query returns a BoM-like results, with indicator results attached to each level of the BoM.
    (For more information, see the notes.) This mixin implements only the indicator results for a given item.
    Separate mixins instantiate and add the child items to the parent.

    Parameters
    ----------
    indicator_results
        Compliance of the ``ItemDefinition`` item for the specified indicators. This parameter does not include
        the full indicator definition, only the indicator name.
    indicator_definitions
        Used as a base to create the indicator results for both this item and the child substances.
    **kwargs
        Contains the ``reference_type`` and ``reference_value`` for ``RecordDefinition``-based objects. It is
        empty for ``BoM1711Definition``-based objects.

    Notes
    -----
    BoMs are recursively defined structures. The top-level item is always a 'Part'. 'Parts' can
    contain zero or more of:
    * 'Parts'
    * 'Specifications'
    * 'Materials'
    * 'Substances'

    'Specifications' can contain zero or more of:
    * 'Specifications'
    * 'Materials'
    * 'Coatings'
    * 'Substances'

    'Materials' and 'Coatings' can both contain zero or more of:
    * 'Substances'

    'Substances' have no children and are always leaf nodes.

    In addition to these items described above, a compliance query result adds ``Indicator`` objects to all items at
    every level.

    This mixin is applied to ``ItemDefinition`` objects to turn them into ``ItemWithCompliance`` objects, where
    'item' is a 'Part', 'Specification', 'Material', 'Coating', or 'Substance'.
