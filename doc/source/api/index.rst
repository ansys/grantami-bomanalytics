API Reference
=============

The BoM Analytics API is split into three key sections, as shown below. The :ref:`ref_bom_analytics_connection` section
describes how to connect to Granta MI, and, if required, configure any schema customizations in the API client. It
also explains how to run queries.

The :ref:`ref_bom_analytics_api_impactedsubstances_index` and :ref:`ref_bom_analytics_api_compliance_index` sections then
explain how to build specific queries and how to interpret the results.

Some of the examples given in the API Reference may use different classes than the one being documented. In all cases,
both classes are equivalent in terms of the functionality being demonstrated.
