23/01 XML BoM types
===================

.. currentmodule:: ansys.grantami.bomanalytics.bom_types.eco2301

The models documented in this section are Python bindings for the Ansys Granta MI 23/01 XML schema.
Not all elements are required to define a valid BoM for analysis, and not all elements have an impact
on all types of analysis. For information on the relevant items for each analysis type,
see :ref:`ref_grantami_bomanalytics_api_index`.

Classes on this page should be imported from the module ``ansys.grantami.bomanalytics.bom_types.eco2301``.

.. note::
   The following elements are defined in the 23/01 BoM schema but are not supported in this module:

   * ``NonMIPartReference`` on :class:`~.Part`
   * ``Annotations`` and ``AnnotationSources`` on :class:`~.BillOfMaterials`

   This module does not contain classes that correspond to these types and cannot serialize a BoM that includes these
   elements. It is still possible to deserialize an XML BoM that uses these elements, but these elements cannot be
   converted to Python objects.

.. versionchanged:: 2.3
   The types documented on this page have moved from ``ansys.grantami.bomanalytics.bom_types`` to
   ``ansys.grantami.bomanalytics.bom_types.eco2301``. They are still importable from the old location for
   compatibility.
