To ensure consistency, the external system defines a step_order field, which represents the order in which processes are applied to the parent part or material. The cells in this section first sort the processes by step_order to ensure that they are added to the BoM correctly.\n\nFirst, apply primary and secondary processes to materials. In the external data source, the parent of a process item is always the parent part, but sustainability analysis expects only a single material assigned to each part.

This is the default value for processes whose environmental impact is calculated based on the mass of material that goes through the process. This mass is calculated from the final mass of the part and mass removed during additional processing steps. For more information on mass calculations, see the Granta MI documentation.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, apply secondary processes to materials. These are added sequentially to the list of processes on the material object, in the same order as defined by the step_order field.\n\nMaterialProcessingStep processes from the external data source are mapped to Process with a MassRemoved dimension type.
